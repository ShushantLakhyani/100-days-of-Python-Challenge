#The input asks for the user to enter the bill amount, and the percentage the user would like to allocate, and the number of people present. the output then prints out the amount to be paid as tip

print("Welcome to the Tip Calculator Application")
total_bill_amount = int(input("Please enter the total bill amount \n"))
print("\n")
percentage_allocation = int(input("What percentage would you like to give ? \n"))
print("\n")
no_people = int(input("How many people would split the bill ? \n"))
print("\n")
total_amount= (total_bill_amount/no_people)*((percentage_allocation+100)/100)
amount = int(total_amount)
print(f"You'll have to pay ${amount}")
