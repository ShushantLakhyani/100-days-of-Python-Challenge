#This would consist of the code for the first project - Band Name Generator
#The project is to apply the concepts of Python strings. The user has to input the city name and their pet's name and the program would generate a band name as the combination of the city name and pet's name

print("Welcome to the band name generator")
city_name = input("Please mention the city you grew up in: \n ")
pet_name = input("Please mention your favorite pet: \n ")
print("The best band name for you is: \n "+ city_name + " " + pet_name)
